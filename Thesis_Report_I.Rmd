# The Skin 

## The Function of the Skin

The skin is the largest organ of the human body and is comprised of a diverse array of specialised cells types. It serves as a critical barrier that protects the internal organs from bacteria invasion, environmental pathogens, ultraviolet (UV) radiation and various biochemical agents.In addition to its protective role, the skin plays a fundamental part in thermoregulation by modulating body temperature and enabling adaptation to fluctuating environmental conditions.[@noauthor_integumentary_nodate]

Furthermore, the skin facilitates the excretion of sweat, sebum, and metabolic waste products through its glandular structures [@noauthor_integumentary_nodate]. It possesses wound-healing capabilities, allowing for the repair of abrasions, lacerations and other forms of tissue injury [@noauthor_integumentary_nodate]. The subcutaneous fat layer functions as a mechanical cushion, providing shock absorption and an additional line of defence against infection [@noauthor_integumentary_nodate].

The skin also contributes to endocrine function through its role in the synthesis of vitamin D upon exposure to UV radiation [@noauthor_integumentary_nodate]. Additionally, it plays a vital sensory role, continuously transmitting information to the central nervous system regarding the external environment [@healthline2018layers]. The skin is integrated with the nervous system to enable the perception of thermal stimuli, tactile sensations, and other sensory inputs essential for survival and interaction with the environment [@healthline2018layers, @noauthor_integumentary_nodate]. 


## The Structure of the Skin

The skin is composed of three primary layers: the **epidermis**, the **dermis**, and the **hypodermis** (also known as the subcutaneous fat layer). Each layer performs specific functions essential to maintaining homeostasis, immunity and overall health.

### The Epidermis

The **epidermis** is the outermost layer of the skin and is primarily composed of keratinocytes, which are specialised cells responsible for the synthesis of keratin, cytokines, growth factors and interleukins. This layer provides the first line of defence against environmental pathogegns and is organised into four distinct strata, arranged from superficial to deep. 

 - *The Stratum corneum*
 - *The Stratum granulosum*
 - *The Stratum spinosum*
 - *The Stratum basale* (also referred to as the *stratum germinativum*
 or the basal cell layer).

An illustrative representation of the epidermis is provided below [@smith2016epidermis].

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='90%', fig.cap="Structure of the epidermis with the different strata, resting on the dermis (Source: Shuttershock.com, Jose Luis Calvo, News Medical 2025)"}

knitr::include_graphics("Images/Epidermis.png")
```

The **stratum corneum** consists of *terminally differentiated* keratinocytes. Terminally differentiated cells exit the cell cycle as they can no longer divide.
The keratinocytes become corneocytes in the stratum corneum. 
*Corneocytes* are non-viable, enucleated cells [@caon2020examination].

The corneocytes function to minimise transepidermal water loss and provide protection against mechanical and microbial damage. Keratin produced in the underlying layers accumulates in the corneocytes, which are eventually shed through a natural process known as desquamation. 

The skin surface is interspersed with pores, which serve as conduits for the excretion of sweat and sebum via eccrine and sebaceous glands, respectively [@healthline2018layers]. 

The **stratum spinosum**, or *prickle cell layer*, lies above the stratum basale and consists of keratinocytes connected by desmosomes, which provide structural support. In this layer, keratinocytes begin producing cytokeratins that form tonofibrils. Langerhans cells, involved in immune defence, are also present in this layer. 

The **stratum granulosum** contains flattened keratinocytes that undergo terminal differentiation. Keratinocytes accumulate keratohyalin granules,involved in keratin aggregation, and lamellar bodies, which secrete lipids that form a barrier to water loss. Keratinocytes in this layer begin to lose their nuclei and organelles as they prepare for transformation into dead corneocytes of the uppermost layer ;the stratum corneum.

The **stratum basale** (or stratum germinativum) is the deepest layer of the epidermis and plays a central role in skin regeneration. This layer has mitotically active keratinocytes, which divide to replenish the upper layers. In addition to keratinocytes, several other specialised cells are found within this layer :

- **Melanocytes**, which produce melanin, the pigment responsible for skin colour and protection against ultraviolet (UV) radiation [@caon2020examination, @koike2018toll]. 

- **Langerhans Cells**, (LCs) a type of dendritic cell (DC) that originate from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow. They have a role in immune surveillance by recognising antigens and initiating T-cell responses [@caon2020examination].

- **Merkel cells**, which are mechanoreceptors involved in the sensation of touch. 

- **Dendritic cells**, which also play a defence role in the immune response as they differentiate into macrophages [@caon2020examination]. 

Within the **stratum basale** UV radiation stimulates the conversion of provitamin $D_{3}$ into pre-vitamin $D_{3}$ that initiates the cutaneous synthesis of vitamin D. Subsequent hydroxylation in the liver and kidneys leads to the production of the active form of vitamin D [@caon2020examination]. 

The epidermis is not only a structural barrier but also a site of pathological relevance. Several dermatological and systemic conditions occur in this layer including **seborrhoeic dermatitis** (dandruff), **psoriasis**, **atopic dermatitis** (eczema), melanoma, **acne vulgaris **, **actinic keratosis** and pressure ulcers (decubitus ulcers) [@healthline2018layers].

\newpage

### The Dermis

The dermis is the middle layer of the skin, situated beneath the epidermis, and serves as the primary site of structural and functional support. It contains many essential components including blood vessels such as capillaries [@caon2020examination], lymphatic vessels, sweat glands , sebaceous glands, hair follicles, nerve endings, and specialised sensory receptors. The dermis is primarily composed of **collagen** and **elastin**, two fibrous proteins that confer tensile strength and elasticity, respectively. 

The dermis is subdivided into two distinct layers:

 - **The papillary dermis**, the superficial layer, which is composed of loose connective tissue and contains capillaries and sensory neurons. 
 
 - **The reticular dermis**, the deeper layer, composed of dense irregular connective tissue rich in collagen and elastin fibres, glands, hair follicles, and larger blood vessels. 
 
The dermis contains sweat glands, sebaceous glands, blood vessels, lymphatic vessels, and other structures critical to skin function. These glands play essential roles in thermoregulation, lubrication, and excretion. The eccrine glands are responsible for sweat production, while the sebaceous glands secrete sebum to maintain skin hydration and barrier function. Both are embedded within the dermal layer and are regulated by hormonal and neural signals.

The dermis contains sweat glands, sebaceous glands, blood vessels, lymphatic vessels, and other structures critical to skin function.

The eccrine glands are responsible for sweat production, while the sebaceous glands secrete sebum to maintain skin hydration and barrier function. Both are embedded within the dermal layer and are regulated by hormonal and neural signals.


Fibroblasts, the predominant cell type in the dermis, are responsible for synthesising collagen proteins, and other components of the extracellular matrix,  which maintains the structural framework of connective tissues. 
In addition to their structural role, fibroblasts are actively involved in **wound healing** through production of signalling molecules and matrix proteins [@genome2025fibroblast].

Collagen is the most abundant protein in the human body and is found not only in the skin but also in muscles, bones, tendons, ligaments, blood vessels, internal organs and the gastrointestinal lining [@clevelandclinic2025collagen]. The primary amino acids in collagen include glycine, proline and hydroxyproline, which assemble into a characteristic triple-helix structure to form collagen fibrils. The biosynthesis of this structure requires several cofactors, including **vitamin C**, **zinc**, **copper** and **manganese** [@clevelandclinic2025collagen].


Among the specialised mechanoreceptors in the dermis are Meissner's corpuscles and Pacinian corpuscles, which detect mechanical stimuli such as touch, pressure, and vibration. These corpuscles are multicellular structures (of multiple cell types) consisting of a sensory nerve ending surrounded by specialised Schwann cells.

 The vascular network within the dermis plays a crucial role in thermoregulation by adjusting blood flow in response to temperature changes [@caon2020examination]. The nerve endings transmit sensory information such as touch, pain, and temperature [@caon2020examination].
Dermal Immune cells contribute to the inflammatory response following injury or infection. 

The dermis contains a diverse population of cells, including fibroblasts, immune dendritic cells, macrophages, T lymphocytes, mast cells, innate lymphoid cells, neutrophils, eosinophils, and natural killer cells, neuronal cells and endothelial cells [@moon2021invitro]. 

Among the immune cells, T lymphocytes are predominantly located in close proximity to blood vessels, vessels, hair follicles and sweat glands within the dermis. Subsets of T cells perform distinct immunological functions: **Th1 cells ** secrete cytokines that enhance the capacity of other immune cells to target and eliminate pathogens l however, dysregulation of Th1 activity may contribute to the development of autoimmune disorders [@moon2021invitro]. **Th2 cells** are primarily involved in the mediation of allergic responses. **Th17 cells** play a crucial role in defending against bacterial and fungal infections and are implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory skin diseases such as eczema and psoriasis.

In contrast, **regulatory T cells (Tregs)** modulate immune responses by suppressing excessive inflammation through the release of inhibitory signals and by eliminating over-active immune cells, thereby maintaining immune homeostasis with the dermis [@moon2021invitro] .
 
Several conditions originate within the dermis, including wrinkles (due to collagen degradation), cellulitis (a bacterial skin infection), dermoid cysts (which may contain hair or teeth), sebaceous cysts, and dermatofibromas.

An illustrative representation of the dermis containing sweat glands, sebaceous glands, blood vessels, lymphatic vessels is shown below[@sweatglands_mayo].

```

### The Hypodermis

The **hypodermis**, also known as the subcutaneous layer of fat, lies beneath the dermis and primarily consists of adipose tissue. This layer is composed of lipocytes that function to insulate the body, maintain thermoregulation, and serve as an energy reserve. The hypodermis also plays a crucial role in absorbing mechanical shock and protecting underlying muscles and organs. 

Structurally, the hypodermis includes the following key components:

 - Fibroblasts: Cells responsible for the production of collagen [@verywell2025hypodermis]. They also regulate the immune response to producing cytokines and chemokines[@moon2021invitro].
 
 - Adipose tissue: Specialised are fatty tissues composed of lipocytes [@verywell2025hypodermis]

 - Connective tissue: A network of collagen and elastin fibres that support and anchors, and gives structure to other tissues[@verywell2025hypodermis].

 - Blood vessels: Including arteries, veins and capillaries that supply the skin with oxygen rich blood and nutrients, while facilitating thermoregulation [@verywell2025hypodermis].

 - Lymphatic vessels: Structures involved in maintaining fluid homeostasis and transporting lymph, a fluid containing immune cells and waste products[@verywell2025hypodermis].

 - Hair follicles: Structures that anchor individual hair shafts and are associated with sebaceous glands and nerve endings.

 - Nerve fibres: Sensory neurons the body's sense of position and movement in space. 

The hypodermis functions as a supportive and protective layer and has important vascular, immune and sensory roles.

# Streptococcus pyogenes

## Streptococcus pyogenes:Taxonomy, Morphology & Clinical Relevance

*Streptococcus pyogenes* is a Gram-positive, anaerobic bacterium commonly referred to as Group A Streptococcus(GAS) [@proctor2023_fibrinogen,@abusaiba2023_review]. 

The Gram-positive nature is due to a thick peptidoglycan layer in its cell wall, which retains the crystal violet stain.

Structurally, *S.pyogenes* is characterised by its beta-hemolytic activity, meaning it causes complete lysis of red blood cells on blood agar plates.
Morphologically, the cells are small, spherical, and typically arranged in chains, a feature that distinguishes them from other bacterial species[@abusaiba2023_review].

Taxonomically, *S.pyogenes* is classified as follows:

 - **Domain**: *Bacteria*
 
 - **Kingdom**: *Bacillati*
 
 - **Phylum**: *Bacillota*
 
 - **Class**: *Bacilli*
 
 - **Order**: *Lactobacillales*
 
 - **Family**: *Streptococcaceae*
 
 - **Genus**: *Streptococcus *
 
 - **Species**: *S.pyogenes* [@abusaiba2023_review]
 
As a highly adaptable pathogen, *S.pyogenes* is capable of causing a wide range of clinical diseases, from mild superficial infections to severe invasive conditions. Its chain-like cellular arrangement and distinct beta-hemolytic properties are key identifiers in both clinical and microbiological contexts. 

## Infection of Human Skin

*Streptococcus pyogenes* is a significant pathogen responsible for a wide spectrum of clinical diseases. Prompt diagnosis and treatment of *S.pyogenes* infections are critical due to the organism's capacity to cause both superficial and systemic illnesses. 

Skin infections caused by *S.pyogenes* range from localised conditions such as impetigo to more severe and invasive diseases, including necrotising fasciitis, a life-threatening infection of the deep dermal and subcutaneous tissues [@nci_streptococcus_pyogenes,@abusaiba2023_review].

In addition to skin infections, *S.pyogenes* is known to cause pharyngitis, pneumonia, scarlet fever, acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, and the autoimmune condition rheumatic fever. In chronic cases,*S.pyogenes* may also contribute to the development of rheumatic heart disease. 

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='90%', fig.cap="Streptococcus pyogenes (Source:National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Flickr, December 29, 2022)"}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/pyogenes2.png")
```

## Virulence Factors of Streptococcus pyogenes
Virulence factors are molecules produced by pathogens that facilitate infection, survival and damage within the host. *S.pyogenes* expresses a diverse array of virulence factors that enable its pathogenicity, immune system invasion, and tissue invasion [@abusaiba2023_review]. 

**1. Capsules**
The bacterium produces a capsule that protects it from being engulfed by the host immune cells.  

**2. Adherence Factors**
Adherence factors (Adhesins), including lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and fibronectin-binding proteins help the bacterium to attach to host epithelial cells and tissues. 

**3. Surface Proteins**
Surface proteins such as M protein and related members (e.g. Mrp and Enn) play crucial roles in immune evasion. These proteins have variable antigens which allow the pathogen to avoid recognition by the host immune system. 

**4. Enzymes**
*S.pyogenes* secretes several enzymes that degrade host tissues and promote bacterial invasion. These include: 

 - **Streptokinase:** Converts plasminogen to plasmin, aiding in the breakdown of fibrin blood clots.
 
 - **Hyaluronidase:** Degrades hyaluronic acid in connective tissue, facilitating bacterial spread.
 
 - **DNases:** Break down extracellular DNA.
 

**5. Toxins**
*S.pyogenes* produces streptolysins (SLO and SLS), exotoxins that lyse red blood cells and other host cells. Additionally, streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins (SPEs) are super-antigens that activate T cells and induce a massive immune response. At least three distinct SPEs have been identified [@abusaiba2023_review].

### The M Protein 

The M protein is a major virulence factor encoded by the emm gene family, which is present in all *S.pyogenes* strains [@proctor2023_fibrinogen]. These surface-anchored proteins are involved in adherence, immune evasion, and resistance to phagocytosis. 

The M protein is considered one of the most important virulence factors. 

- **Structure:** The M protein is a coiled-coil molecule anchored in the bacterial membrane, with a highly variable N-terminal region responsible for antigenic diversity. 

- **Function:** It interferes with opsonisation and complement activation, making it a key player in immune system evasion. The M-protein changes surface antigens to make it harder for the host to recognise the pathogen.

- **Variants:** M-related proteins such as Mrp and Enn, along with fibronectin-binding proteins, are also expressed and contribute to pathogenicity. 

### F proteins
F proteins are another group of surface adhesins produced by *S.pyogenes*. These include fibrinogen-binding and fibronectin-binding proteins, which facilitate tight adherence to host tissues and are critical in the early stages of infection. 

### Streptolysins and Exotoxins 
- Streptolysin O (SLO) and Streptolysin S (SLS) are cytolytic toxins that cause hemolysis and contribute to tissue damage during infection. 

- Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins (SPEs) are potent super-antigens activate T cells and stimulate a massive immune response, often leading to severe systemic symptoms.

### Lipoteichoic Acid and Vaccine Targets

Lipoteichoic acid is a key surface molecule involved in adherence and immune activation, and it is under investigation as a potential target for vaccine development [@abusaiba2023_review]. 

## Antimicrobial Resistance 

*S.pyogenes* also harbours genes associated with antimicrobial resistance. Notable among these are:

 - **lmrP:** Encodes a multidrug efflux pump
 - **tetM and tetL:** Confer resistance to tetracyclines. 
 - **tgfT:** involved in resistance to specific antimicrobial agents [@boutin2024_genomic].
 
These resistance genes highlight the need for continuous surveillance and prudent use of antibiotics in treating *S.pyogenes* infections.

## Biofilm Formation and Quorum Sensing in Streptococcus pyogenes

Biofilms are structured microbial communities encased within a self-produced extracellular matrix. In *Streptococcus pyogenes*, biofilm formation facilitates communication between cells and contributes to bacterial surviva, particularly under host immune response and exposure to antibiotics. This communication is mediated by a mechanism known as quorum sensing, which regulates gene expression in response to cell density. 

In *S.pyogenes*, one of the key quorum sensing pathways involved in biofilm development is the Rgg2/3 pathway.This pathway controls the expression of genes involved in biofilm formation through the modulation of short hydrophobic peptides, which act as quorum sensing pheromones, also referred to as autoinducers.

Short hydrophobic peptides are initially synthesised in an immature form within the bacterial cell. To become functionally active, these peptides undergo a two-step processing mechanism. First, an intracellular metalloprotease enzyme processes the SHPS. Subsequently, they undergo further processing in the extracellular environment to reach their mature, biologically active form.

The specific transport mechanism responsible for the SHP export and the identity of the extracellular processing factor(s) remain to be elucidated.

The Rgg2/3 pathway is essential for biofilm maturation and plays a central role in *S.pyogenes* pathogenesis, particularly in facilitating persistent infections by enhancing resistance to host immune defences and antimicrobial agents.

# Melanoma

## Introduction to Melanoma

Melanoma is a highly prevalent form of skin cancer originating from the melanocytes [@sinha2025nrp1, @tao2024melanoma, @li2025integrating, @liu2022gene].

As mentioned in the earlier section, Melanocytes are cells that contribute to skin colouration due to the creation of melanin[@mayo2025melanoma]. A tumour occurs when the DNA mutates inside of the Melanocyte cells [@mayo2025melanoma, @jayaraj2024bioinformatics]. Melanoma is notable for its high metastatic potential[ @li2025integrating, @xie2025centromere]. 

Melanoma has several distinct subtypes, including Acral Melanoma[@tsetsos2025], Mucosal Melanoma and Uveal Melanoma, each arising in different anatomical sites and with unique molecular profiles[@jayaraj2024bioinformatics]. In contrast to keratinocyte carcinomas which include basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, these melanomas originate from melanocytes[@tsetsos2025]. 

## Related Skin Cancers
Other rare cutaneous malignancies include Sebaceous Carcinoma and Apocrine Adenocarcinoma, as well as Merkel Cell Carcinoma, a neuroendocrine tumour strongly linked with exposure to ultraviolet light. Although these cancers are less common than melanoma, they use similar methods for diagnosis and molecular testing.

The development of Melanocytes from neural crest cells (NCCs) is regulated by a network of growth factors and intracellular signalling pathways[@xie2025centromere, @koike2018toll]. 

The most important regulatory molecules are endothelins and stem cell factors.
Stem cell factors are ligands for the c-Kit receptor. Other critical growth factors include members of the Wnt protein family and Neuregulin-1 (NRG1). 

### Neuregulin-1

Neuregulin-1 (NRG1) is a growth factor that is known for its pleiotropic effects[@sinha2025nrp1]. 
In addition to its role in melanocyte biology, NRG1 is a key growth factor within the nervous system. It promotes development of Schwann cells, glial cells that form the myselin sheath, while also supporting neuron growth and enhancing synaptic plasticity.

Furthermore, Neuregulin-1 contributes to the repair of the cardiac and vascular tissues and acts via ErbB receptors.

### The Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway

The Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway is central to the development of melanocytes[@liu2022gene]. This pathways plays a fundamental role in cell survival, proliferation and differentiation. Signalling pathways are cascades of protein interactions that respond to growth factors to direct the cells. 

The MAPK pathway is activated when stem cell factors bind to the c-Kit receptors on the melanoblast cell surface. The binding event initiates a signalling cascade that leads to the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs).
These kinases move to into the nucleus and activate gene expression processes required for melanocyte development and melanin biosynthesis.  

Understanding how melanocytes normally develop is important for figuring out how melanoma begins and spreads, since problems in these signalling pathways are often involved in the disease process. 

## Diagnosis and Imaging Techniques
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the primary diagnostic tool for Melanoma.
MRI can be conducted with or without the use of contrast agents to enhance lesion visualisation. In cases where imaging results are inconclusive or suspicious, a biopsy is performed to obtain a tissue sample for histological and molecular examination[@tao2024melanoma].

Histopathological analysis typically involves immunohistochemical staining protocols, where tissue samples are incubated in biotin and stained used haematoxylin blue/black nuclear stain and eosin pink cytoplasmic stain to highlight cellular architecture and pathology[@tao2024melanoma]. To preserve biological integrity for subsequent analyses, the specimen are often cryopreserved. 

## Molecular and Genetic Characterisation 
The identification of genetic mutations and molecular pathways involved in melanoma is pivotal for both diagnosis and the development of targeted therapies. Several genes are recognised as therapeutic biomarkers and are investigated for the presence of mutations [@tao2024melanoma]. 

Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) relates to the small number of cancer cells that may remain in the body during or after treatment for Melanoma and potentially lead to recurrence. Minimal Residual Disease is typically assessed via liquid biopsy, a minimally invasive technique that analyses circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) in cerebrospinal fluid, blood or urine.

This ctDNA analysis is referred to as fragmentomics and it uses advanced techniques such as Digital PCR (dPCR) and Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR) to detect mutations.

Micro-RNAs (microRNA) also play a significant role in melanoma pathogenesis.
For example, miR-21 is often up-regulated in patients with Melanoma and breast cancer. These non-coding RNAs are regulators of gene expression and may serve as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers[@tao2024melanoma].

## Omics Approaches in Melanoma Research 
Comprehensive molecular profiling using omics based technologies has changed the classification and understanding of melanoma [@sinha2025nrp1]. 
Transcriptomics, which investigates the full range of RNA transcripts expressed in tumour cells, provides insight into the functional state of cancerous tissues [@sinha2025nrp1]. 
Methylomics, focusing on DNA methylation patterns reveals epigenetic modifications that contribute to the oncogenesis and may serve as early diagnostic indicators. 
Microarray based transcription profiling is employed for high throughput analysis of gene expression, while cell surface proteomic analysis enables the identification of differentially expressed membrane proteins. 

## Molecular Subtyping and Future Directions
Molecular subtyping of melanoma has become a cornerstone of personalised oncology. 
By integrating data from genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics, clinicians and researchers can classify tumours into subtypes that inform prognosis and therapeutic response. This systems biology approach not only enhances diagnostic precision but also opens up avenues for novel targeted treatments[@xie2022identification]. Bioinformatics studies may provide a clearer understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind melanoma metastasis[@xie2022identification].

Further insights into the overlap between cutaneous and Uveal Melanoma have been gained through bioinformatics approaches which identify shared gene expression signature and signalling pathways[@jayaraj2024bioinformatics]. 
Such comparative analyses deepen the understanding of melanoma heterogeneity and path the way for cross-subtype therapeutic strategies[@xie2022identification].

This is a diagnostic plot where each point represents a gene. The x-axis shows the average log2-counts per million (logCPM) for each gene. The y-axis shows the estimated variance (or square root of standard deviation) of the log2 expression values for each gene. The trend line is plotted over the points to estimate the mean-variance relationship in the dataset. The mean-variance trend shows a relatively stable variance across expression levels, indicating the normalization and statistical modelling are appropriate for differential expression analysis.

This heatmap shows the pairwise correlations between the samples in the dataset.Yellow signifies a strong correlation and blue signifies no correlation. 
The rows and columns represent the same set of samples. Samples are hierarchically clustered based on their correlation. 
Similar samples are grouped together. However, there is 1 melanoma sample that is clustering with the nevi skin samples.
